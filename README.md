## TCCM Model (lite)
The goal of the Terminology Core Common Model (TCCM) is to accomodate terminology resources from disparate data models. It will, by necessity, assemble its data from ouside (ideally definitive) sources.

The TCCM model is the set of [LinkML](https://github.com/linkml/linkml)-based definitions of the data models core to TCCM. 

## Disambiguation
Not to be confused with [TCCM Model (full spec)](https://github.com/HOT-Ecosystem/tccm).

[TCCM Model (lite)](https://github.com/HOT-Ecosystem/tccm-model) is a much 
simpler version of the model, used by the current [TCCM API](
https://github.com/HOT-Ecosystem/tccm-api).

[TCCM Model (full spec)](https://github.com/HOT-Ecosystem/tccm) is in development, 
but is ultimately intended to supplant the existing, 'lite' version of the model.

Model schema directory disambiguation:
- `tccm_model/`: This is the working, production model.
- `model/`: This is a mixed purpose development model; ignore this directory unless you are a TCCM developer.
